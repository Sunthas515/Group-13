All you need to do is ensure you are on your own working branch and commit any changes to that.
Then just send me a message in the group chat and I will update the other branches from there.

- [X] Implement a different method to solve numerically
- [X] Plot the jumpers position over time
- [ ] Does the model agree with 10 bounces across 60 seconds?
- [ ] What is the maximum speed and when does it occur? Answer graphically
- [ ] What is the maximum acceleration? Is the claim of experiencing "up to 2g" valid?
- [ ] Find how far the jumper travels within the 60 seconds.
- [ ] What delay should the camera at deck height be set to?
- [ ] What properties of the bungee rope could be changed to experience a 'water touch'? (keep to 10 bounces 60s and no greater than 2g)
