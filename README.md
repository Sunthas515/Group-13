All you need to do is ensure you are on your own working branch and commit any changes to that.
Then just send me a message in the group chat and I will update the other branches from there.

- Implement a different method to solve numerically
- Plot the jumpers position over time
1. Does the model agree with 10 bounces across 60 seconds?
2. What is the maximum speed and when does it occur? Answer graphically
3. What is the maximum acceleration? Is the claim of experiencing "up to 2g" valid?
4. Find how far the jumper travels within the 60 seconds.
5. What delay should the camera at deck height be set to?
6. What properties of the bungee rope could be changed to experience a 'water touch'? (keep to 10 bounces 60s and no greater than 2g)
